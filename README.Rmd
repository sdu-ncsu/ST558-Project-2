# Packages

## Tidyverse

The workhorse of this project for 3 main core packages: DPLYR - manipulated all of my data (selects, joins, filter, new variables... ), Tibble for rendering Data Frames more effectively, & () ggplot2 for discrete & continuous data plots

## Rmarkdown 

Key to the project for the Rmd file itself including the knitr:: functions for consumable object output (kable) & README.md github doc output through render()

## Caret

Used to create standardized train/test data & create controls and tuning for LM & GLM analysis

# Render Code

Link to file [here](https://github.com/tkidol/ST558-Project-2/blob/main/P2_Render.Rmd)

`ibrary(dplyr)
library(rmarkdown)

charDay <- c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")

numDay <- c("0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6")

output_file <- paste0(charDay,"Analysis.md")

params <- lapply(numDay, FUN = function(x) (list(day = x)))


reports <- tibble(output_file, params)

apply(reports, MARGIN = 1, 
               FUN = function(x) { 
                 render("P2_TKIdol.Rmd", output_file = x[[1]],
                 params = x[[2]])
               })`
