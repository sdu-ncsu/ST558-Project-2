# Packages

## Tidyverse

The workhorse of this project for 3 main core packages: DPLYR - manipulated all of my data (selects, joins, filter, new variables... ), Tibble for rendering Data Frames more effectively, & () ggplot2 for discrete & continuous data plots

## Rmarkdown 

Key to the project for the Rmd file itself including the knitr:: functions for consumable object output (kable) & README.md github doc output through render()

## Caret

Used to create standardized train/test data & create controls and tuning for LM & GLM analysis

# Set Parameters & Knit

# Introduction

You should have an introduction section that briefly describes the data and the variables you have to work
with (no need to discuss all of them, just the ones you want to use). If you are analyzing the bike share
data, do not use the casual and registered variables to do any modeling!
You should also mention the purpose of your analysis and the methods youâ€™ll use (no need to detail them
here) for analysis.

# Data

```{r, data}

bikeData <- read.csv("hour.csv")

# removing casual & registered vars since they will not be used for modeling
bikeData <- bikeData  %>% select(everything(), -c("casual", "registered")) %>% mutate(weekday = as.factor(weekday))

# filtering for individual weekday reporting
bikeData <- bikeData  %>% filter(weekday == params$day)

latenight <- bikeData %>% filter(hr == 3)
latenightcount <- sum(latenight$cnt)
latenightcount
```
# Summarizations

```{r, summaries}

sumBikeData <- bikeData %>% select(dteday, season, hr, workingday, weathersit, temp, hum, windspeed, cnt)

# create factors for season, timeofday and weather
sumBikeData <- mutate(sumBikeData, workday = as.factor(ifelse(sumBikeData$workingday == 0, "no", "yes")),
                                   season = as.factor(ifelse(sumBikeData$season == 1, "winter",
                                                      ifelse(sumBikeData$season == 2, "spring",
